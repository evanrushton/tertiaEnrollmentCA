An exploration of California's Enrollment Data   (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

There is other data available http://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/

Question: How have Charter schools affected Public/Private school enrollments?

These are the R scripts for my CA enrollment project that can be followed on my data science blog https://evanrushton.github.io/

As the data files get a bit large, please get in touch if you'd like me to provide them. I have created a Tableau Public data store and will continue to update it (2018).
