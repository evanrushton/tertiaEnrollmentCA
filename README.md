An exploration of California's Enrollment Data   (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

Driving Question: How have Charter schools affected Public/Private school enrollments?

These are the R scripts for my CA enrollment project that can be followed on my data science blog.

I wrote about the cleaning process for the data: https://evanrushton.github.io/Data-Cleaning/

and an interactive Tableau vizualization on ethnicity: https://evanrushton.github.io/CA-ethnic/

As the data files get a bit large, please get in touch if you'd like me to provide them. I have created a Tableau Public data store and will continue to update it (2018).

There are other data available at http://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/, reach out if you'd like to help merge more of it or have specific requests.
